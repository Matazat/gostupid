Is there a character that could even possibly EVEN TOUCH Madara Uchiha? 
Let alone defeat him.
 And I'm not talking about Edo Tensei Uchiha Madara.
 I'm not talking about Gedou Rinne Tensei Uchiha Madara either.
 Hell, I'm not even talking about Juubi Jinchuuriki Gedou Rinne Tensei Uchiha Madara with the Eternal
 Mangekyou Sharingan and Rinnegan doujutsus (with the rikodou abilities and being capable of both
 Amateratsu and Tsukuyomi genjutsu), equipped with his Gunbai, a perfect Susano'o, control of the
 juubi and Gedou Mazou, with Hashirama Senju's DNA implanted in him
 so he has mokuton kekkei genkai and can perform yin yang release ninjutsu while being an
 expert in kenjutsu and taijutsu.
